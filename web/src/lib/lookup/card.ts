 * the treebank sentence it stands in, the core vocabulary and LSJ. It shows the dictionary form, the kind of word, ONE
 * meaning with its source named, what the word does in this sentence (only where the treebank says), and its grammar in
 * plain words. Nothing here is composed: a meaning is a core-list definition or LSJ's short definition, word for word,
