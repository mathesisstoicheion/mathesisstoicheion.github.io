  summary: `More of Euripides' plays survive than of Aeschylus' and Sophocles' put together. Nineteen have come down to us more or less complete, though one of them, the *Rhesus*, is often thought not to be his. Some ancient scholars credited him with ninety-five plays; the Suda says ninety-two at most.[^1] Part of the reason so many survive is that his popularity grew as theirs declined: in the Hellenistic Age he became a cornerstone of ancient literary education.[^1]

He did not win easily. He first competed in 455 BC, and did not win first prize until 441. In all he won first prize only five times: four in his lifetime and one after his death, when the *Bacchae* and *Iphigenia at Aulis* were produced in 405.[^1] *Alcestis* (438) took second prize and stood in the place normally held by a satyr play. *Medea* (431) was third, *Hippolytus* (428) first and the *Trojan Women* (415) second.[^1] Aristophanes made him a character in at least three plays, the *Acharnians*, the *Thesmophoriazusae* and the *Frogs*.[^1]

He is the tragedian who sounds most like people talking. Aristotle says so in the *Rhetoric*: art is best hidden when the speaker “chooses his words from ordinary language and puts them together like Euripides, who was the first to show the way”.[^2]

{legend} Tradition says he was born on the island of Salamis, about 480 BC, on the very day of the battle there, and that he ended his life at the “rustic court” of King Archelaus in Macedon, dying in 406.[^1] Some modern scholars think he may never have gone to Macedonia at all.[^1]

### Things readers still argue about

**Is the *Rhesus* his?** It is among the nineteen, but its authorship is a matter of dispute.[^1]

**How many plays did he write?** Some ancient scholars said ninety-five; the Suda said ninety-two at most.[^1]`,

  transmission: `**Two streams.** The plays reached the Middle Ages by two routes. One was a select edition of ten plays, circulated about AD 200 and “possibly for use in schools”; its plays survive in many medieval manuscripts. The other was a group of nine plays in alphabetical order. “Some unknown Byzantine scholar” put the two together, which gave the nineteen plays we have.[^1]

**Two manuscripts for nine plays.** The alphabetical plays are preserved in L, in the Laurentian Library at Florence, and P, in the Palatine Library.[^1]

**Fragments on papyrus.** The fragments of the lost *Hypsipyle* are extensive enough to allow tentative reconstructions of the play.[^1]

**Print.** Four plays were printed at Florence in about 1494 (*Medea*, *Hippolytus*, *Alcestis* and *Andromache*), and Aldus Manutius printed all the plays but the *Electra* at Venice in 1503.[^3]`,

  variants: `**Plays with only two witnesses.** The nine alphabetical plays survive through two manuscripts alone, L in the Laurentian Library at Florence and P in the Palatine Library, so they have no second route to fall back on.[^1]

**A play in dispute.** The authorship of the *Rhesus* is a matter of dispute.[^1]

**Fragments.** What survives of his lost plays is gathered in Kannicht's *TrGF* 5.[^10]`,
