 * ("The Trojan Women" under T for Trojan, "A True Story" under T for True, "The Deipnosophists" under D), and so are
 * leading numbers and a leading part in brackets ("1 Corinthians" under C, "(Sophonias) Commentary on the Parva

 * ones, go together at the end, under "#". (The owner, 2026-10-31: the titles A to Z "starts on S and is all messed up".)
