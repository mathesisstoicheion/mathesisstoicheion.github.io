        <h2>Pictures</h2>
        <p>
          Every picture in the Painted Stoa comes from a collection that states its licence, and the licence is copied from that record
          by the script that fetched it (<code>web/scripts/fetch-images.ts</code>). Pictures from The Metropolitan Museum of Art are from its
          Open Access programme (CC0: free for any use). Photographs from Wikimedia Commons keep their photographers&apos; licences.

        <h2>Manuscripts</h2>
        <p>
          The reader&apos;s Manuscript panel shows pages of real manuscripts from the libraries&apos; and projects&apos; own image servers; no
          photograph is copied to this site. Which pages hold which work comes from each library&apos;s catalogue (<code>src/data/manuscripts.ts</code>).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Venetus A</b> (Venice, Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana, Marc. gr. Z. 454 = 822): photographs and the index of every Iliad line on its page, the <a href="https://www.homermultitext.org/" rel="noopener">Homer Multitext project</a>, Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (the index: CC BY-NC 4.0, built by <code>pipeline/build_manuscripts.py</code>).</li>
          <li><b>The Medicean manuscript of Aeschylus and Sophocles</b> (Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Plut. 32.9): photographs, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, <a href="https://tecabml.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/plutei" rel="noopener">Teca digitale</a>, for personal and non-commercial use; contents by folio from <a href="https://portail.biblissima.fr/" rel="noopener">Biblissima</a>.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>The amphora on the home page and all ornament are drawn by this site&apos;s own code. Photographs of real objects arrive with the wiki, each with its source, creator and licence listed here.</p>

        <h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No adverts, no analytics, no trackers and no cookies.</li>
          <li>Fonts and code are served from this site, so your browser does not contact Google or any other company just to show a page.</li>
          <li>Your settings, your recent searches, reading positions, bookmarks, notes, highlights, saved words, unsent forum drafts and everything else in the Treasury, the vase you paint on the home page, and the people you have hidden in the Town Hall, are stored only in this browser, on this computer. “Download my Treasury” saves a copy as a file on your computer; nothing is uploaded.</li>
          <li>When you are online and a text is not in your downloaded library, your browser fetches that text&apos;s file from GitHub (raw.githubusercontent.com).</li>
          <li>When you look up a word or open its Word Study page while online, that word (and nothing else) is sent to Wiktionary (en.wiktionary.org).</li>
          <li>When you open the reader&apos;s Manuscript panel, your browser fetches that manuscript&apos;s photographs from its library&apos;s image server: the Homer Multitext project (homermultitext.org) for the Iliad, the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana (via OCLC&apos;s contentdm.oclc.org) for Aeschylus, Sophocles and Apollonius, or the Bibliothèque nationale de France (gallica.bnf.fr) for Plato. Only the page asked for is requested. The Places panel uses only this site&apos;s own map.</li>
          <li>The reader&apos;s <b>Listen</b> button reads the English translation with a voice from your own device or browser; this site sends nothing. Most voices work on the device itself, but some browsers&apos; online voices (in Microsoft Edge, those whose names end in “Online (Natural)”) are made on the browser maker&apos;s servers, so the passage being read goes to them. The Greek is never read aloud.</li>
          <li>Downloading the library fetches the text files from GitHub. Links to Logeion and Perseus take you to those sites only when you click them.</li>
          <li>
            <b>The Town Hall, the Pnyx and accounts</b> are kept by <a href="https://supabase.com" rel="noopener">Supabase</a>, on servers in the European
            Union (Ireland). Your browser contacts Supabase on those pages and on your account page, when you are signed in, and on the home page, which
            reads the latest forum threads and the motion of the week (a read-only request that carries nothing but your internet address, as
            every request does); reading, study and the wiki never do. An account holds your email address (used only to sign you in and to send the confirmation and
            password-reset letters; never shown to anyone), your password (stored by Supabase in scrambled form, never readable), your
            display name and what you write about yourself.
          </li>
          <li>What you write in the Town Hall and the Pnyx, and your display name, are public. Your upvotes can be seen by others; your
            pebble in a debate cannot: only the totals are shown, once the debate closes. Reports are seen only by the moderator.</li>
          <li>A bug report is a public thread like any other. The form fills in the page you were on and a short description of your browser
            (its name and version, the system, and the window&apos;s size); you see both before sending and can change or remove them. Nothing else about your computer is sent.</li>
          <li>If you choose to keep your Treasury in step between devices, a copy of it is stored in your account, readable only by you.</li>
          <li>You can delete your account at any time from your account page: this removes your account, your profile, everything you
            wrote in the Town Hall and the Pnyx, your votes and your stored Treasury.</li>
