Publish the large generated data packs to their own GitHub Pages site, so the live site can use them:
  https://mathesisstoicheion.com/packs/words/…   word analyses   (pipeline/build_words.py)
                                     /lsj/…     LSJ              (pipeline/build_lsj.py)
                                     /lexicon/… Word Study index (web/scripts/build-lexicon.ts)
                                     /search/…  Oracle index     (web/scripts/build-search.ts)
The live site is built with NEXT_PUBLIC_PACKS=/packs (.github/workflows/deploy.yml, web/src/config/packs.ts).
Same address as the site: visitors' browsers contact no one else, and the offline helper can keep the files.

Each run replaces the whole repository with one fresh commit (the files are rebuilt, not edited, so no
history is kept and the repository stays the size of the data, about 760 MB; GitHub Pages allows 1 GB).

Needs, once: an empty public repository github.com/mathesisstoicheion/packs, with Settings → Pages →
"Deploy from a branch", branch main, folder / (root). See DEPLOYMENT.md.

Usage:  python pipeline/publish_packs.py            check and stage only (prints what would be sent)
        python pipeline/publish_packs.py --push     also push (replaces what is online)

the structure of each sentence (`syntax/`), the Liddell–Scott–Jones dictionary (`lsj/`), the Word Study index
(`lexicon/`) and the search index (`search/`). They are rebuilt by the site's pipeline and replaced here as a whole; do not edit them by hand.
